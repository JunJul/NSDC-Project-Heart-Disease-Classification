# NSDC-Project-Heart-Disease-Classification
Dataset comes from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease

led 5 members in NSDC club @ UCLA to develop classification models that predict whether an adult has 
heart disease in Python.

Explored data with Descriptive Statistics by Statsmodel.Logit, matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas .

Utilized the XBGClassifier, the Logistic Regression, the DecisionTreeClassifier, and the RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn.

Obtained a decent 97% F1-score and 96% validation score by N-fold cross-validation in the RandomForestClassifiser model.
