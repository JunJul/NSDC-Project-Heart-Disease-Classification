# NSDC-Project-Heart-Disease-Classification
Dataset comes from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease

led three team members in NSDC club @ UCLA to develop classification models to predict whether an adult has 
heart disease.

Explored data with Descriptive Statistics by Statsmodel.Logit, matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Developing the XBGClassifier, the Logistic Regression, the DecisionTreeClassifier, and the RandomForestClassifier by scikit-learn.

Obtained a decent 97% F1-score and 96% validation score by N-fold cross-validation technique in the RandomForestClassifiser model.
